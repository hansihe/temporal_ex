# Backend Boundary

The backend boundary is the server-facing interface between Temporalex and an external workflow backend.

For v1, the backend behaviour combines transport and protocol translation. This keeps the server tests durable: tests can use a backend that sends core structs directly, while the real backend can use Rustler, Temporal Core, protobuf, and ETF payload conversion internally.

The detailed Temporal Core mapping is documented in [temporal_core_mapping.md](temporal_core_mapping.md).

## Design Rule

The server talks in core structs. It does not know about protobuf bytes, Rustler resources, Temporal Core worker objects, or network protocol details.

The backend owns those details.

## Behaviour Shape

The exact callback names may evolve during implementation, but the server-facing contract should look like this:

```elixir
defmodule Temporalex.Backend do
  @type state :: term()

  @callback start_worker(opts :: keyword(), owner_pid :: pid()) ::
              {:ok, state()} | {:error, term()}

  @callback complete_workflow_activation(
              state(),
              Temporalex.Core.Completion.t()
            ) :: :ok | {:error, term()}

  @callback complete_activity_task(
              state(),
              Temporalex.Core.ActivityCompletion.t()
            ) :: :ok | {:error, term()}

  @callback shutdown_worker(state()) ::
              :ok | {:error, term()}
end
```

Client operations can be added later as separate callbacks or a separate client backend. The first backend contract should focus on worker execution.

## Backend Messages

The backend sends already-decoded core structs to the server:

```elixir
send(owner_pid, {:workflow_activation, %Temporalex.Core.Activation{}})
send(owner_pid, {:activity_task, %Temporalex.Core.ActivityTask{}})
send(owner_pid, {:backend_error, reason})
send(owner_pid, {:backend_worker_shutdown, reason})
```

If a real backend internally receives protobuf bytes, it decodes them before sending messages to the server.

## Completion Submission

The executor builds workflow completions, but the server submits them:

```elixir
{:workflow_activation_completion, run_id, %Temporalex.Core.Completion{}}
```

The server validates the completion against its pending activation registry and calls:

```elixir
backend.complete_workflow_activation(backend_state, completion)
```

Workflow completions are status-bearing. The backend maps `{:ok, commands}` to Temporal Core's successful activation completion and `{:failed, reason, opts}` to Temporal Core's activation failure completion.

For activity tasks, the server runs the activity and builds `%Temporalex.Core.ActivityCompletion{}` before calling:

```elixir
backend.complete_activity_task(backend_state, completion)
```

## Test Backend

`Temporalex.Backend.Test` should be able to drive server integration tests without Temporal.

It can:

- start with plain Elixir state
- send `%Temporalex.Core.Activation{}` messages directly to the server
- collect completions for assertions
- simulate backend errors and worker shutdown
- avoid all bytes and NIF calls

Example test shape:

```elixir
{:ok, worker} =
  start_supervised({Temporalex.Worker,
    name: MyApp.Temporal,
    backend: Temporalex.Backend.Test,
    workflows: [MyWorkflow],
    activities: []
  })

Backend.Test.send_activation(worker, %Core.Activation{...})

assert %Core.Completion{} =
  Backend.Test.fetch_workflow_completion(worker, run_id)
```

These tests should remain valid when `Temporalex.Backend.TemporalCore` exists.

Implementation status:

- `Temporalex.Backend` is implemented as the server-facing behaviour.
- `Temporalex.Backend.Test` is implemented and stores workflow/activity completions in memory for assertions.
- `Temporalex.Backend.TemporalCore` exists as an explicit placeholder that returns `{:error, {:not_implemented, message}}` until the native bridge is added.
- `test/temporalex/backend_conformance_test.exs` exercises the backend contract against the test backend and asserts the real backend placeholder fails clearly.

## Temporal Core Backend

`Temporalex.Backend.TemporalCore` will implement the same behaviour using the real native layer.

Responsibilities:

- create or obtain the native runtime
- connect to Temporal
- start a Temporal Core worker
- run native poll loops
- decode workflow activation protobuf bytes into `%Temporalex.Core.Activation{}`
- decode activity task protobuf bytes into `%Temporalex.Core.ActivityTask{}`
- encode `%Temporalex.Core.Completion{}` into workflow activation completion bytes
- encode `%Temporalex.Core.ActivityCompletion{}` into activity completion bytes
- submit completions through Rustler NIFs
- convert payloads with `:erlang.term_to_binary/1` and `:erlang.binary_to_term/1`

The codec modules can live under the real backend, for example:

```elixir
Temporalex.Backend.TemporalCore.Codec
Temporalex.Backend.TemporalCore.PayloadConverter
```

Those modules can have direct unit tests with protobuf fixtures, but they are not the main server boundary.

## Boundary Checks

Backend implementations must not leak backend-specific structs past the boundary.

Allowed server-facing data:

- `%Temporalex.Core.Activation{}`
- `%Temporalex.Core.ActivityTask{}`
- `%Temporalex.Core.Completion{}`
- `%Temporalex.Core.ActivityCompletion{}`
- plain error terms

Not allowed past the boundary:

- protobuf structs
- raw activation bytes
- Rustler resources
- Temporal Core worker/client handles
- task tokens except as fields of core activity structs where activity semantics require them

## Failure Semantics

Backend failures should become server messages or callback errors.

Examples:

- poll loop crash sends `{:backend_error, reason}`
- completion submission failure returns `{:error, reason}` or sends a tagged completion result
- worker shutdown sends `{:backend_worker_shutdown, reason}`

The server decides whether a backend error is fatal to the worker tree.
