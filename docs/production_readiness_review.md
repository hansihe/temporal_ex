# Production Readiness Review

Review date: May 8, 2026.

This document tracks the implementation review performed after the native Temporal Core integration. It compares the current Temporalex surface against the local Temporal documentation in `../../documentation`, Temporal API protos in `../../temporal-api`, and the checked-out Temporal Core SDK in `../../temporal-sdk-core`.

The current architecture looks broadly sane for Elixir: workflow command construction is executor-owned, backend transport stays behind `Temporalex.Backend`, workflow code uses BEAM processes for durable blocking, and the Rust NIF wraps Temporal Core without exposing protobufs to workflow code. The remaining items below are the issues that keep the library from being production-ready.

## High Priority

### Search Attributes Must Be Server-Readable

Status: open.

Current concern:

- `native/temporalex_nif/src/lib.rs` uses `term_to_payload_map/1` for headers and search attributes.
- `payload_from_term/1` encodes values as ETF payloads with `encoding = binary/erlang-eterm`.
- Temporal Search Attributes are indexed visibility fields; Temporal's proto states that Search Attribute payloads are not user-defined serialization.
- Temporal Core's own payload visitor skips Search Attribute payload encoding so the server can read them.

References:

- `../native/temporalex_nif/src/lib.rs`: `payload_from_term`, `term_to_payload_map`, workflow start search attributes, upsert search attributes.
- `../../temporal-api/temporal/api/common/v1/message.proto`: `Payload`, `SearchAttributes`.
- `../../temporal-sdk-core/crates/common/src/payload_visitor.rs`: search attributes skipped during payload encoding.
- `../../documentation/docs/encyclopedia/visibility/search-attributes.mdx`: supported Search Attribute types and visibility behavior.

Needed:

- Add a dedicated Search Attribute encoder instead of reusing the ETF payload converter.
- Support Temporal Search Attribute types: Bool, Datetime, Double, Int, Keyword, KeywordList, and Text.
- Apply it consistently to workflow start, continue-as-new, child workflows when added, and `upsert_search_attributes/1`.
- Add real Temporal dev-server tests that start/upsert Search Attributes and verify they can be queried through visibility.

### Workflow Cancellation Semantics Are Incomplete

Status: open.

Current concern:

- `Job.CancelWorkflow` only sets `cancelled?: true`.
- `Workflow.API.cancelled?/0` only reads that flag.
- Cancellation does not unblock timers, signal waits, phases, activities, parallel branches, or update/signal handlers.
- `{:cancelled, reason}` drops the cancellation reason/details when emitting `Command.CancelWorkflow`.
- Temporal distinguishes graceful cancellation from termination. Cancellation should schedule workflow code so it can clean up.

References:

- `../lib/temporalex/core/executor.ex`: `Job.CancelWorkflow`, `Cancelled` op, root `{:cancelled, _reason}` handling.
- `../lib/temporalex/core/structs.ex`: `Command.CancelWorkflow`.
- `../native/temporalex_nif/src/lib.rs`: `CancelWorkflowExecution` command encoding.
- `../../temporal-api/temporal/api/command/v1/message.proto`: `CancelWorkflowExecutionCommandAttributes.details`.
- `../../documentation/docs/develop/rust/workflows/cancellation.mdx`: cancel versus terminate behavior.

Needed:

- Design cancellation scopes or an equivalent Elixir-native cancellation model.
- Define how workflow cancellation resolves or interrupts `sleep`, `wait_for_signal`, `phase`, `parallel`, activities, and handlers.
- Emit `CancelTimer` and activity cancellation commands where appropriate.
- Preserve cancellation details in the terminal cancel command and in decoded client result errors.
- Add core replay tests and real-server tests for cancellation while blocked on timers, activities, phases, and handlers.

### Failure Modeling Is Too Flat

Status: open.

Current concern:

- `failure_from_term/2` turns every workflow, query, and update failure into `Temporalex.ApplicationError`.
- `non_retryable` is always false.
- Failure details are a single ETF payload of the original term.
- Retry policies using `non_retryable_error_types` cannot be expressed well by users.

References:

- `../native/temporalex_nif/src/lib.rs`: `failure_from_term`, `failure_to_term`.
- `../../temporal-api/temporal/api/common/v1/message.proto`: `RetryPolicy.non_retryable_error_types`.
- `../../temporal-api/temporal/api/failure/v1/message.proto`: Temporal failure variants.

Needed:

- Add public error/failure structs for application failures, cancellation, timeouts, activity failures, child workflow failures when added, and update rejection.
- Allow users to set application error type, message, details, and non-retryable flag.
- Decode server/core failures into stable Elixir terms or structs instead of lossy maps/strings.
- Add tests proving workflow and activity retry policies respect non-retryable error types.

### Continue-As-New Is Under-Modeled

Status: open.

Current concern:

- Workflow code can only return `{:continue_as_new, args}`.
- The NIF encodes only workflow type, task queue, and arguments.
- Temporal supports run timeout, task timeout, retry policy, header, memo, search attributes, start backoff, and versioning behavior on continue-as-new.

References:

- `../lib/temporalex/core/executor.ex`: root `{:continue_as_new, args}` handling.
- `../native/temporalex_nif/src/lib.rs`: `ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution` command encoding.
- `../../temporal-api/temporal/api/command/v1/message.proto`: `ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionCommandAttributes`.
- `../../documentation/docs/develop/rust/workflows/continue-as-new.mdx`: continue-as-new usage and suggestion API.

Needed:

- Add a workflow API helper for continue-as-new with options.
- Support continue-as-new options that Temporal Core exposes and that fit deterministic workflow semantics.
- Carry typed Search Attributes through the new Search Attribute encoder.
- Expose `continue_as_new_suggested` and history length/size through workflow info if not already complete.
- Add core tests and real-server tests for chained runs and option propagation.

## Medium Priority

### Client Should Not Require A Running Worker

Status: open.

Current concern:

- `Temporalex.Client` routes operations through a running `Temporalex.Worker` and its backend state.
- This is convenient for local integration tests but is not the usual SDK model.
- A production client should be usable from web processes, jobs, IEx, or services that do not host workflow workers.

References:

- `../lib/temporalex/client.ex`: public client API and worker lookup.
- `../lib/temporalex/backend/temporal_core.ex`: native client operations.

Needed:

- Introduce a supervised client process or resource independent of workers.
- Keep worker APIs ergonomic by allowing workers to reuse an existing client or build one from config.
- Ensure handles can be used with a client without retaining a worker name.

### Missing Client Operations And Options

Status: open.

Current concern:

The current client covers start, get result, signal, query, execute update, cancel, terminate, and describe. Useful SDK primitives/options are still missing:

- Signal-with-start.
- Start update/update handle, not only execute update.
- Update-with-start.
- Query reject condition.
- Workflow list/count/history fetch.
- Workflow start request id, memo, start delay, priority, links, callbacks, versioning override, on-conflict options, and eager execution controls where supported.

References:

- `../lib/temporalex/client.ex`: current public API.
- `../native/temporalex_nif/src/lib.rs`: `workflow_start_options`, `query_options`, `update_options`.
- `../../temporal-api/temporal/api/workflowservice/v1/request_response.proto`: `StartWorkflowExecutionRequest`, `SignalWithStartWorkflowExecutionRequest`, `QueryWorkflowRequest`, `UpdateWorkflowExecutionRequest`, `ExecuteMultiOperationRequest`.
- `../../documentation/docs/develop/rust/workflows/message-passing.mdx`: signal-with-start and update handle behavior.

Needed:

- Add these incrementally with backend conformance tests and real-server tests.
- Prefer Elixir-friendly handles and option names while preserving Temporal semantics.

### Missing Workflow Primitives

Status: open.

Current concern:

The current workflow API covers activities, timers, signals, queries/updates through phase, deterministic time/random/uuid, patch markers, Search Attribute upsert, parallel, and state publishing. Production SDK parity needs more primitives:

- Child workflows.
- External workflow signal/cancel.
- Cancellation scopes or cancellation handles.
- Local activities.
- Side effects and mutable side effects, if they can be modeled without weakening replay.
- Memo upsert.
- A general `wait_condition` or await-predicate API.
- Workflow logging/interceptors/headers where they can be deterministic and useful.

References:

- `../lib/temporalex/workflow/api.ex`: current workflow primitives.
- `../lib/temporalex/core/structs.ex`: current job, op, and command structs.
- `../../temporal-api/temporal/api/command/v1/message.proto`: child workflow, external signal/cancel, memo modification, Nexus commands.
- `../../documentation/docs/develop/rust/workflows/child-workflows.mdx`: child workflow behavior.
- `../../documentation/docs/develop/rust/workflows/message-passing.mdx`: wait conditions and handler patterns.

Needed:

- Add primitives only when they satisfy `docs/implementation_principles.md`.
- Each primitive needs executor-level command/replay tests before relying on the real backend.

### Retry Policy Validation Bug

Status: open.

Current concern:

- `retry_policy_from_term/1` rejects negative `backoff_coefficient` but allows values between 0 and 1.
- Temporal requires the coefficient to be 1 or larger.

References:

- `../native/temporalex_nif/src/lib.rs`: `retry_policy_from_term`.
- `../../temporal-api/temporal/api/common/v1/message.proto`: `RetryPolicy.backoff_coefficient`.

Needed:

- Reject explicit values below 1.0.
- Add native option validation tests for `0.0` and `0.5`.
- Consider validating `maximum_interval >= initial_interval` if Temporal Core/server does not already give a clear error.

## Testing Strategy Gaps

Status: open.

Current coverage:

- The real Temporal dev-server integration test covers worker startup, workflow start/result, timers, activities, heartbeats, signal/query/update/describe, termination, and one invalid start option path.
- Core tests cover deterministic command emission, replay mismatch, phase/update/query behavior, patch markers, and process teardown for the implemented surface.

Missing production-confidence tests:

- Search Attribute visibility against the dev server.
- Cancellation while blocked on timer, activity, phase, signal wait, update handler, and parallel branch.
- Activity retry and non-retryable error behavior against the server.
- Continue-as-new chains, including result retrieval across runs and option propagation.
- Workflow ID reuse/conflict policies against running and closed workflows.
- Query reject condition behavior.
- Update rejection, async update completion, and update handles when implemented.
- Worker restart/replay against real history.
- Backend conformance tests that compare fake backend and Temporal Core backend behavior for shared operations.
- Payload/failure decoder tests for all public error surfaces.

## Lower Priority Or Explicitly Deferred

These are not tracked as blockers in this document unless priorities change:

- Sibling checkout dependencies for `../temporal-sdk-core` and `../temporal-api`.
- Pluggable data converters or safe ETF mode.
- Production packaging, CI, and release automation.
- Nexus support, unless it becomes a near-term product requirement.
